Basic Brine
-----
Basic brine that I use for everything (chicken, turkey, beef, pork)
-----
8 count - bay leaves
---
1 tbsp - black pepper corns
---
3/4 cup - brown sugar
---
1 cup - kosher salt
---
1 gallon - water
-----

*If your favorite herb mix contains salt or sugar you should consider leaving it out. With the brine you could easily over season the meat.

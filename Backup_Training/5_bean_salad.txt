5 Bean Salad
-----
This particular recipe is different than your typical multi-bean  salad.  Normally it has a dressing that tastes good  nice and vinegary   but also very sweet.  I could have done the same thing and just used  splenda, but why does everything have to be sweet?  I used an EVOO base  to create a flavorful, savory, almost-spicy dressing.  It works  incredibly.

1 can - black beans

1 can - chick peas

2 tsp - chili powder

2 pinch - cilantro

2 tsp - cumin ground

1/4 cup - extra virgin olive oil

1 can - green beans
---
1 can - kidney beans
---
2 tsp - lime juice
---
2 pinch - oregano
---
1 can - pinto beans
---
2 tsp - salt

Rinse and drain all the beans and place in a bowl.

In a separate container, combine the oil, lime juice, and the dry ingredients. Mix well.

Pour the oil mixture over the beans, and with a spatula slowly turn over from the bottom to the top, rotating the bowl as you go. Eventually itll all get picked up and coated evenly

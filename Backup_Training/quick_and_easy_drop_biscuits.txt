-----
1 1/2 cups - all purpose flour

2 tsp - baking powder
---
4 oz - cold unsalted butter cut into 1/4 inch pieces and refrigerated

1 tsp - salt

3/4 cup - whole milk

1. Preheat oven to 400F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper; alternatively grease a baking sheet with butter.

2. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.

3. Toss butter into the dry ingredients until coated with flour. Working quickly and using your fingers or a pastry blender, rub or cut butter into flour until it resembles coarse meal. Alternatively, add flour mixture and butter to food processor and pulse 2 to 3 times to form pea-sized pieces; transfer to a large bowl.

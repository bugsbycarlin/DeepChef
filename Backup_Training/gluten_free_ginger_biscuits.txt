Gluten-Free Ginger Biscuits
-----
I often double the recipe, and make a couple of batches at once.
-----
1/4 teaspoon - Baking Soda
---
4 oz (1/4 of a pound) - Butter
---
1 teaspoon - Cinammon
---
1 - Egg Beaten
---
8 oz (2 cups) - Gluten Free Flour (Healtheries Baking Mix is good, Rice Flour is good, but Pure Cornflour is too light)
---
1 Tablespoon - Golden Syrup (heat the spoon first)
---
1 teaspoon - Ground Allspice/Mixed Spice
---
2 teaspoons - Ground Ginger
---
1/2 teaspoon - Salt
---
6 oz (3/4 cup) - Sugar
-----
Place oven racks on the second (from the bottom), and 4th rungs.
---
Pre-heat oven to 170C (350F).
---
Line 2 baking trays with baking or greaseproof paper (or grease trays with butter).
---
Sift the dry ingredients into a bowl.
---
Melt the sugar, syrup and butter in a pot, and then cream together.
---
Beat egg, and add this to the butter and sugar, before mixing with the dry ingredients.
---
The dough should be quite firm and dry (if it is sticky, add more flour).
---
Roll into teaspoon sized balls (or use a desert spoon, if you would like slightly larger biscuits), and place onto the oven tray. If you would like moist, cakey, mushroom shaped bisuits, then do not squuash them, but if you prefer flatter crunchier biscuits, press them onto the tray with a fork (optional: sprinkle a little sugar on the top).
---
Put into the oven, on the lower rack, and lower the temperature to 150C (300F). Bake for 5-10 minutes, until cooked on the bottom, then move them up to the 4th rung, for 10-15 more minutes (20 minutes total time in oven).
---
Take them out if you notice that they are starting to brown on the top.
---
Place onto a cooling rack, and try to wait until they have cooled down before you enjoy them (best dipped into your favourite hot drink).

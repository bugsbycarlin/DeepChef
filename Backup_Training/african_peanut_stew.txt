African Peanut Stew
-----

-----
1/4 bunch - cilantro
---
1/2 bunch - collard greens
---
1/4 tsp - crushed red pepper
---
1 tsp - cumin
---
4 cloves - garlic
---
1 inch - ginger
---
1 - onion medium
---
1/2 cup - peanut butter
---
1 lb - sweet potato
---
6 oz - tomato paste
---
6 cups - vegetable broth
---
1 tbsp - vegetable oil
-----
Peel and grate the ginger using a small holed cheese grater. Mince the garlic. Saut the ginger and garlic in vegetable oil over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or until the garlic becomes soft and fragrant.
---
Dice the onion, add it to the pot, and continue to saut. Dice the sweet potato (1/2 inch cubes), add it to the pot, and continue to saut a few minutes more, or until the onion is soft and the sweet potato takes on a darker, slightly translucent appearance. Season with cumin and red pepper flakes.
---
Add the tomato paste and peanut butter, and stir until everything is evenly mixed. Add the vegetable broth and stir to dissolve the thick tomato paste-peanut butter mixture. Place a lid on the pot and turn the heat up to high.
---
While the soup is coming up to a boil, prepare the collard greens. Rinse the greens well, then use a sharp knife to remove each stem (cut along the side of each stem). Stack the leaves, then cut them into thin strips. Add the collard strips to the soup pot.
---
Once the soup reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and allow it to simmer without a lid for about 15 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are very soft. Once soft, smash about half of the sweet potatoes with the back of a wooden spoon to help thicken the soup. Taste the soup and add salt if needed (will depend on the brand of broth used).
---
Serve the stew hot with a few cilantro leaves if desired.

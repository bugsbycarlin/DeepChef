-----

-----
1 can (28 oz) - crushed tomatoes
---
1 handful - basil leaves
---
1 cup - chopped onion
---
2 large - eggs
---
3 cloves - garlic
---
14 whole - Lasagna Noodles
---
8 ounces - low moisture mozzarella
---
2 tablespoons - olive oil
---
2 ounces - parmesan cheese
---
1/8 teaspoon - red pepper flakes
---
15 ounce - ricotta cheese
---
1 jar (12 oz) - roasted red peppers
---
1 to taste - salt and pepper
---
2 medium - yellow squash
---
2 medium - zucchini
-----
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 13-inch by 9-inch baking dish or spray with non-stick cooking spray.
---
Heat olive oil in a wide skillet with sides over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally until translucent; 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic, red pepper flakes, zucchini, squash, and a pinch of salt then cook, stirring occasionally until softened but still with some crunch; 5 to 8 minutes.
---
Stir in the roasted red peppers and crushed tomatoes. Bring to a low simmer and cook until the liquid has thickened and reduced by half; 5 to 8 minutes. Add the basil and season to taste with additional salt and pepper.
---
Spoon just enough vegetable mixture into the baking dish to lightly cover the bottom (about 1 cup). Arrange four noodles lengthwise and side by side to cover the bottom. (If the noodles are short on one end, you may need to cut an extra noodle and place into dish to cover where the other noodles have not).
---
Spread about half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Sprinkle with a third of the parmesan cheese and a third of the mozzarella cheese. Top with a third of the vegetable mixture. Add another layer of four noodles then repeat with remaining cheese and vegetables. Finish with a final layer of noodles, vegetables, parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese.
---
Cover loosely with aluminum foil and bake 20 minutes, uncover then bake 15 minutes until cheese is crusty around the edges. To make the cheese golden brown on top, slide under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes. Let rest 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
---
Stir ricotta, eggs, and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a medium bowl until blended.
---
Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil then cook lasagna noodles according to package directions. (We add a couple teaspoons of olive oil to the water so the noodles do not stick together). Drain then lay flat on a sheet of aluminum foil.

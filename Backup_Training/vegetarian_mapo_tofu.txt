Vegetarian Mapo Tofu
-----

-----
15 oz - block of soft tofu (not silken)
---
1 tbsp - corn-starch dissolved in 3 tbsp cold water
---
1 tbsp - fermented black beans rinsed
---
1 tbsp - fermented spicy broad bean paste (doubanjiang)
---
2 tsp - garlic minced
---
1 tbsp - ginger grated
---
8 oz - shiitake mushrooms
---
1 tsp - Sichuan pepper finely ground
---
1/2 cup - slivered scallions
---
3 - small dried hot red peppers
---
2 tsp - soy sauce
---
1 tsp - toasted sesame oil
---
3 tbsp - vegetable oil
---
2 cups - water
-----
Remove stems from mushrooms. Make a light mushroom broth by simmering stems in 2 cups water for 15 minutes, then strain and reserve broth (discard stems). Dice mushroom caps and set aside.
---
Cut tofu into 1-inch cubes. Cover with boiling salted water, let steep for 15 minutes, then drain.
---
Put oil in a wok or wide skillet over medium heat. Add red peppers, black beans and bean paste and cook, stirring until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add garlic and ginger and let sizzle, then add mushrooms, soy sauce, sesame oil and Sichuan pepper. Add 1 1/2 cups mushroom broth and cook mixture gently for 2 minutes.
---
Carefully add tofu cubes. Shake pan to distribute sauce, using a wooden spoon to help. Try to avoid smashing tofu. Drizzle in cornstarch mixture, gently swirling pan to incorporate (sauce will thicken) and simmer tofu in sauce for 2 minutes more. Thin with a little mushroom broth if necessary. Transfer to a low bowl or platter. Sprinkle with scallions and cilantro sprigs.

Brownies
-----
I added a Nutella swirl on the top (melted nutella and placed a layer once it was in the baking pan and swirled it into the brownies) for some extra zest and flavor.
-----
1 cup - almond flour
---
1/4 tsp - baking soda
---
1/2 cup - cocoa
---
1/2 cup - coconut oil melted
---
3 - eggs
---
2/3 cup - honey
---
1/4 tsp - sea salt
---
1 tbsp - vanilla extract
-----
Heat oven to 350 degrees.
---
place coconut oil and honey into a microwave safe bowl and microwave for approx. 15 seconds (until coconute oil is melted)
---
whip the eggs in a mixer bowl with the vanilla until fluffy. Add the coconute oil and the honey. Add the almond flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt until well mixed.
---
Pour into a greased pan (I use glass with parchment paper lining - but greasing with coconut oil works too) and place into the oven for approx 25-30 minutes.

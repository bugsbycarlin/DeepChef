Once cooked, it should have some juice (about 1 cup for the whole dish). Make the avgolemono : Beat up an egg white to a stiff meringue add the egg yolk and the juice of one and a half lemon. While beating gradually add as much as possible of the hot juice from the dish and incorporate. Tip the whole avgolemono in the dish and shake around so that it goes everywhere.

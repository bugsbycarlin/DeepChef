CARAMELIZE THE ONION:While the beet and carrots roast, in a large pan (nonstick if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium until hot. Add the sliced onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add 1 tablespoon of water. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until ver tender. Add the tomato paste and remaining thyme; cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until dark red. Add the vinegar and 1/4 cup of water(Be Careful, as the liquid may splatter)Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until well combined. Transfer to a bowl

FORM LATKES:While the onion cooks, crack the egg into a large bowl; beat until smooth. Grate the potatoes and remaining onion half on the large side of a box grater. Place in the bowl of beaten egg and season with salt and pepper. Add the matzo meal; mix until thoroughly combined. Using your hands, divide the mixture into 6 equal-sized portions, squeezing out and discarding any excess liquid. Flatten each portino onto a 1/4 inch round and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.

Carefully discard the oil and wipe out the pan.

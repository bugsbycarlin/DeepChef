Salt encrusted Standing Rib Roast
-----
A easy way to make an outstanding roast. It only has four ingredients! Don't let all the salt fool ya. I have made this four times now and not once was it overly salted. The salt crust comes right off after cooking

1 tablespoon - black pepper

3 cups - kosher salt
---
5 pound - rib roast three bone

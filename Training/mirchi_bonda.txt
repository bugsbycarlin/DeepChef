Wash chillies well.As the chillies were too big, I did not want to deep fry the whole chillies as in traditional way. I chopped them into half inch round pieces to use less oil. You can go ahead and prepare in the usual way.Prepare the bonda batter.Add all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and add 1/4 cup of water and make a paste. Make sure there are no lumps. Now, add around 1/2 Cup of water and make a thin paste.Check for salt and spices. Add more if required.Note: Add water slowly. The thickness should be little thinner than milkshake. It should be thick enough to hold on to the pieces.Note: I have noticed that adding soda will give bondas crunchiness. It tastes too good but makes bondas absorb oil.Heat oil in a pot for deep-frying.Dip each chilli piece in bonda batter. Coat well and drop in hot oil carefully. Repeat the same.Note: Do not over crowd. Less heat and more bondas will absorb oil and won't cook properly.After a minute or two, turn bondas around and let them fry for another 2 minutes.Carefully remove the fried bondas. Place them on a plate lined with tissue to soak up extra oil.Enjoy. :)

Garlic Mash taters

Wonderful potato's with a hint of garlic made with red potoatos. I use the pre cooked and minced garlic that you can find at the grocery store in a jar.

1 dash - black pepper
---
2 tablespoons - butter
---
3 cloves - garlic minced
---
1 dash - kosher salt
---
1/2 cup - milk
---
1 pounds - red potatos
-----
Cut the red potatoes up in to small chunks and add them to a large stock pot of water.

Boil the potatoes on the stove till they are tender. Drain them from the pot and add them to a large mixing bowl.
---
Add the butter, garlic and milk to the potato mixture. Mix well with a hand mixer till they are nice and smooth.

Add salt and pepper to taste.

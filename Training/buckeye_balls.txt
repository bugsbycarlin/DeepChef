Buckeye Balls
-----
These are chocolate-covered balls of peanut butter and confectioners' sugar that are made to look like the Ohio Buckeye nut. Peanut butter + chocolate do I need to say more?
-----
6 ounces - baking chocolate semi-sweet
---
1/2 cup - butter softend
---
1 1/2 cups - peanut butter creamy
---
4 cups - powder sugar sifted
---
2 tablespoons - shortning
---
2 teaspoons - vanilla extract
-----
Line a baking sheet with waxed paper; set aside.
---
In a medium bowl, mix peanut butter, butter, vanilla, and confectioners' sugar with hands to form a smooth stiff dough. Add the last cup of sugar slowly. You may not needed it, if the dough is almost right sprinkle the sugar till you get it perfect.
---
Shape into balls using 2 teaspoons of dough for each ball. Place on prepared pan, and freeze.
---
Melt shortening and chocolate together in a metal bowl over a pan of lightly simmering water. Stir occasionally until smooth, and remove from heat.
---
Remove balls from freezer. Insert a wooden toothpick into a ball, and dip into melted chocolate. Return to wax paper, chocolate side down, and remove toothpick.
---
Repeat with remaining balls.

Refrigerate for 30 minutes to set.

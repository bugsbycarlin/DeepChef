Prime Rib with horseradish crust
-----
Delicious fool proof way to make prime rib. A big head every christmas.
-----
2 tablespoon - black pepper
---
2 whole - carrots chunked
---
1 head - garlic halved
---
5 whole - garlic cloves smashed
---
1/4 cup - horseradish
---
1/2 cup - olive oil
---
2 whole - parsnips chunked
---
1 3-rib - prime rib roast
---
1 whole - red onion halved
---
2 sprigs - rosemary
---
3 tablespoons - sea salt
---
4 sprigs - thyme
-----
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
---
Lay the beef in a large roasting pan with the bone side down. (The ribs act as a natural roasting rack.)
---
In a small bowl mash together the garlic, horseradish, rosemary, thyme, salt, pepper, and olive oil to make a paste.
---
Massage the paste generously over the entire roast.
---
Scatter the vegetables around the meat and drizzle them with a oil.
---
Put the pan in the oven and roast the beef for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours for medium-rare (or approximately 20 minutes per pound).
---
Check the internal temperature of the roast in several places with an instant-read thermometer; it should register 125 degrees F. for medium-rare.
---
Remove the beef to a carving board and let it rest for 20 minutes.

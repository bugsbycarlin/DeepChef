1/2 cup - broccoli florets diced
---
1/2 cup - carrots diced
---
2 cans - coconut milk
---
1 can - coconut milk
---
1 tbsp - curry powder
---
1 - dried red chili diced
---
4 cloves - garlic minced
---
1 tbsp - ginger grated
---
1 tbsp - oil
---
1 - onion small, diced
---
1 cup - quinoa rinsed
---
1/3 cup - snow peas loosely cut
---
1/4 cup - tomato diced
---
1 cup - veggie stock
-----
If serving with coconut quinoa, begin by washing thoroughly in a fine mesh strainer. Add to a medium saucepan over medium heat and toast for 3 minutes. Add 1 can light coconut milk and 1/2 cup water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer, cover and cook for 15 minutes or until the quinoa is light, fluffy and the liquid is absorbed. Set aside until serving.
---
In the meantime, heat a large saucepan or pot to medium heat and add 1 Tbsp coconut oil. Add the onion, garlic, ginger, carrot, broccoli and a pinch each salt and pepper and stir. Cook, stirring frequently, until softened about 5 minutes.
---
Add curry powder, cayenne (or chili pepper), veggie stock, coconut milk, another healthy pinch of salt and stir. Bring to a simmer then reduce heat slightly and continue cooking for 10-15 minutes.
---
Add the snow peas and tomatoes in the last 5 minutes so they dont overcook.
---
Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added another pinch or two of salt.
---
Serve over coconut quinoa (see other options below in Notes) and garnish with fresh lemon juice and herbs.

Can easily modify this to fit your tastebuds. I created a very clean basic as the first attempt!
-----
1 can - Dice Tomatoes
---
1 large - Eggplant Sliced
---
2 cloves - garlic Diced
---
1/2 Medium - Onion diced
---
1 tblsp - tomato paste
---
2 Medium - zucchini slices
-----
Egg Batter the slices of Eggplant and bake for approx 30 minutes until they are brown, crispy, and a little dried out.
---
While the eggplant is baking, take a clove or two of garlic, dice, then place into a large pan with some olive oil. Sautee on medium low. While the Garlic is sauteeing, dice up half of a medium onion (I used sweet onion!) and place into the pan with the garlic until the onion slices start to "clear"
---
Add in the meat of choice (I did about a pound of ground beef) until brown. add a tblsp of tomato paste, seasons of your choice (I used oregano, basil, rosemary, a little cumin, a touch of cinnamon, and some garlic infused olive oil) and 1 can of diecd tomatoes and let simmer for 30 minutes.While this is simmering, I placed about 9 mushrooms sliced into a pan and slightly cooked them, then tossed them into my now simmering meat sauce!
---
I then peeled and sliced a couple Zucchinis and put those to the side.
---
Once the Eggplant is nice and crispy, take out of the oven and place a layer covering the bottom of a bread pan (I used glass. No need to grease the pan though!)
---
Then I placed a layer of my meat sauce on top of the eggplant layer. Then added a layer of Zucchini! I did this until I was out of eggplant and meat sauce then placed some Basil and Parsley on top - threw it in the oven for about 30-45 minutes until the top was nice and cooked and the zucchini looked ready to eat! VOILA!

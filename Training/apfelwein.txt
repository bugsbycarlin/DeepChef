Apfelwein
-----
A nice light wine with a hint of apple. The wife request that I make this several times a year. Make sure the apple juice is 100% juice otherwise the yeast won't ferment. You will need some special equipment for this recipe. You should be able to find most of it at your local brew store or online at abrew shop.Corn sugarwine yeastsanitizer, a 5 gallon vessel that is food safe such ascarboy, bottles to store the wine in, and asiphonto move the wine to the bottles, aair lockanstopperare also needed. Brown sugar can be substituted for corn sugar but it will have a lower ABV and more of a cider taste.

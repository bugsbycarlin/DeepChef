Tuff Girl Protein Pancakes
-----
I use a vanilla protein powder (BioChem) that has very little flavor and no additional sugars.
-----
3 tbsp - almond flour
---
2 tsp - baking soda
---
1.5 medium - bananas Smashed
---
2 large - eggs
---
2 scoops - protein powder mix
---
2 tbsp - vanilla extract
-----
Smash the banana super good. It needs to a liquid consistency.
---
Add in the eggs and whisk together very well. next, add in the vanilla, baking soda, and cinnamon and whisk well!
---
add in the protein powder and the almond flour and whisk until it's very well mixed together!
---
Let the pan warm up to medium heat (these cook quickly! within a minute - so don't turn the burner too hot! I place mine usually on a "4")
---
Pour the batter onto a lightly greased pan. Add chocolate chips if you want them! flip when the bottoms start to brown (Just lightly lift a corner to check after about 45 - 60 seconds)

These are an amazing post workout meal! quick and easy!

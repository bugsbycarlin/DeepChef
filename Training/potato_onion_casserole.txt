Potato Onion Casserole
-----
This is something between potatoes dauphine and potatoes lyonnaise. It is one of the best dishes on earth. The longer you cook the onions the better it tastes. You can make it the night before, add a little diced ham or chicken, and put it in the oven when you get home from work for an amazing dinner. It would be great with fontina or gruyere cheese or trying different herbs.

Put butter, brown sugar and sliced onions into a large pot over medium heat. Cook until onions are dark brown and almost mush, about 45 minutes to an hour, stirring from time to time.Slice your tators to about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Put one layer of potato rounds in the bottom of a rectangular casserole dish. Put a thin layer of caramelized onions on top followed by a sprinkle of rosemary, a sprinkle of cheese, a drizzle of cream and a pinch of salt and pepper. Repeat the layers until you are out of potatoes or onions. I usually get about three layers but it would depend on the size of your casserole dish.Cook at 375 for 50 minutes to an hour. Test tator layers with a fork to make sure they are done. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes.

Jamaican Goat Curry
-----
Slow cooked goat stew Jamaican-style. This stew can be made on the stove-top or in the crockpot. Times reflect stove-top cooking. This can be made with lamb or beef in lieu of goat, as availability requires. Additional coconut milk or curry powder can be added to taste.
-----
1 tablespoon - allspice
---
8 ounce - coconut milk
---
15 ounce - crushed tomatoes
---
6-8 tablespoon - curry powder
---
1 tablespoon - dried thyme
---
1 tablespoon - garlic minced
---
1 teaspoon - ginger minced
---
3 pounds - goat meat
---
1 - habanero pepper seeded and chopped
---
1 - jalepeno pepper seeded and chopped
---
2 - onions chopped
---
5 - potatoes peeled and cut into 1 inch cubes
---
1 dash - salt
---
15 ounce - tomato sauce
---
.4 cup - vegetable oil
---
3-4 cups - water
-----
If you can find Jamaican curry powder, use it and omit the allspice. If not, use regular curry powder and add the allspice to it. Add 6 tbsp of curry powder, more if you like it more spicy.
---
Cut the meat into large chunks, maybe 2-3 inches across. Feel free to add the bones if you have them; you can remove them later.
---
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Mix in 2 tablespoons of the curry powder and heat until fragrant.
---
Pat the meat dry and brown well in the curried oil. Do this in batches and dont overcrowd the pot. It may take a while to do this, maybe 30 minutes or so. Set the browned meat aside in a bowl. (When all the meat is browned, if you have bones, add them and brown them, too.).
---
Add the onions and pepper to the pot and saut, stirring from time to time, until the onions just start to brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle some salt over them as they cook. Add the ginger and garlic, mix well and saut for another 1-2 minutes.
---
Put the meat (and bones, if using) back into the pot, along with any juices left in the bowl. Mix well. Pour in the coconut milk and tomatoes and 4-5 tablespoons of the curry powder. Add 4 cups of water. Stir to combine. Add the thyme.
---
If you want to cook on the stove, bring to a simmer and let it cook until the meat is falling-apart tender, which will take at least 2 hours. Longer if you have a mature goat. If you want to cook in a crockpot, transfer the mixture to the crockpot and cook on low for 8-10 hours.
---
If you have cooked the meat on the stove, add the potatoes when the meat is close to being done - tender but not falling apart. Cook about 30 minutes or until the potatoes are done. Then, skim the fat off the top of the pot if needed.
---
If you cooked the meat in the crockpot, boil the potatoes until tender. Skim the layer of fat off the top of the curry, if needed, and mix in the potatoes.
---
If you used bones, remove them before serving.

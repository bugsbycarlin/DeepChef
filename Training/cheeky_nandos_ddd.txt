Cheeky Nando&#39;s DDD
-----
For this recipe we use the Nando's Peri-Peri Sauce and not their premade marinade. Experiment as you please. For this we need a frying pan, a grill and foil-backed greaseproof paper.
-----
2 x - Chicken Breast Meat
---
4 Tbsp - Greek Yoghurt Marinade
---
1 x - juice of 1 lemon Marinade
---
1 Tsp - Lazy Garlic / Minced Garlic Marinade
---
1/2 Tsp - Mixed Herbs Marinade
---
5 Tbsp - Peri-Peri Sauce Marinade
---
1/4 Tsp - Salt Marinade
---
1-2 Tsp - Sugar Marinade
-----
A. Preparation Phase
---
Cut both chicken breasts into short slices, each less than about a centimetre in thickness and place them into the mixing bag. It's now ready marinade as follows:
---
1.Pour 2no tablespoons worth of Nando's peri-peri sauce in
---
2.Add in the yoghurt
---
3.Add a teaspoon of pre-mixed herbs
---
4.Squeeze in the juice of half a lemon
---
5.Add to the chicken one large minced clove of garlic or alternatively add a teaspoon of Lazy Garlic
---
6.Optional: add the sugar and salt
---
7.Shake shake shake! Squeeze most of the air out of the bag, grab it by the top and shake it around thoroughly
---
8.Leave it for at least half an hour. The longer the better!
---

---
B. Frying Phase
---
It's time to start cooking. Get out the frying pan, heat it up to a medium to low heat and throw in the chicken mixture. Occasionally stir it and scoop up anything that looks like it's going to burn if it stays put, including the sauce. Add a little bit of water from time to time, just enough so that there is an ever so slight puddle of water at the bottom of the pan -- this is to stop the chicken from drying out as we go.
---
It should be good to go after about 15 minutes, but this can vary according to how you sliced it. You know the drill with chicken, any pink at all is bad. And remember, don't let it dry.
---
Once it's cooked through, take it off the heat and add another 2no spoon of peri-peri sauce.
---

---
C. Grilling Phase
---
Lay it all out on foil-backed paper so that none of the chicken is overlapping and place it on the top shelf of the grill. Keep it in there for 10-15 minutes. This can vary again according to the slice thickness but also your grill. We want it to be so there are pointy crispy bits on top but it's still juicy on the inside. Check it at 10 minutes and go from there.
---

---
D. Serving Phase
---
Once it's done in the grill, put all the chicken into a bowl, add in the final 1no spoon of peri-peri sauce and mix it all up!
---
Voila. Peri-peri chicken at home. Not too far removed from the real thing!
